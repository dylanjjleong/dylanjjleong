I am interested in the sensible application of data science in economic modelling. In particular, how NLP techniques can improve data paucity/quality and whether state-of-the-art predictive algorithms can outperform traditional econometric methods in general equilibrium models of international trade and economic forecasting.

I am currently pursuing a [Master of Data Science and Innovation](https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/master-data-science-and-innovation) at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) as a Postgraduate Academic Excellence International Scholar. Before this, I conducted research on international trade with the [Department of Political Science](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/pol/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg) as a research trainee under the supervision of [Sooyeon Lee Kim](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/2496-sooyeon-lee-kim). I received my undergraduate degree from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg) in 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) in Economics.
